    larger: |
        Grasp {better} has a higher {feature} metric than grasp {worse}. 
        I predict grasp {better} has a higher chance of success than grasp {worse}.
    
    smaller: |
        Grasp {worse} has a smaller {feature} metric than grasp {better}. 
        This implies grasp {worse} is likely to be unsuccessful compared to grasp {better}
